<h1>ORM Concept with Hibernate - Assignment</h1>

<p>This repository contains the source code and configuration files for the Hibernate Assignment on ORM Concepts. The assignment is divided into two parts: Part 1 covers CRUD operations on a single entity (<code>Book</code>), and Part 2 focuses on relationships between entities (<code>Book</code> and <code>Author</code>) using Hibernate.</p>

<h2>Part 1: CRUD Operations on a Single Entity</h2>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p>The objective of Part 1 is to assess the student's ability to use Hibernate for performing CRUD operations on a single entity (<code>Book</code>). Students will focus on the <code>Book</code> entity and its associated attributes.</p>

<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Set up a Java project and configure Hibernate with a suitable database (e.g., MySQL, H2) for this assignment.</li>
<li>Create the necessary Java classes representing the <code>Book</code> entity with appropriate annotations for mapping.</li>
<li>Implement the following CRUD operations for the <code>Book</code> entity:
    <ul>
        <li>Create a new book and save it to the database.</li>
        <li>Retrieve a book by its ID from the database.</li>
        <li>Update an existing book's attributes (e.g., title, ISBN) and save the changes to the database.</li>
        <li>Delete a book from the database.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Test the CRUD operations to ensure they are working correctly by using a simple console-based application.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Part 2: Relationships between Entities (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)</h2>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p>The objective of Part 2 is to assess the students' understanding of creating and managing various types of relationships between entities using Hibernate. The students will work with two entities: <code>Book</code> and <code>Author</code>.</p>

<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create the necessary Java classes representing the <code>Book</code> and <code>Author</code> entities with appropriate annotations for mapping.</li>
<li>Implement the following relationships between entities using Hibernate annotations:
    <ul>
        <li>One-to-One: Each book can have only one author. Update the <code>Book</code> entity to have a one-to-one relationship with the <code>Author</code> entity.</li>
        <li>One-to-Many: Each author can have multiple books. Update the <code>Author</code> entity to have a one-to-many relationship with the <code>Book</code> entity.</li>
        <li>Many-to-Many: Each book can have multiple authors, and each author can have multiple books. Implement a many-to-many relationship between the <code>Book</code> and <code>Author</code> entities.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Implement the following tasks related to relationships:
    <ul>
        <li>Save the <code>Author</code> entity independently, and then associate it with the corresponding <code>Book</code> using the one-to-one relationship.</li>
        <li>Save the <code>Book</code> entities independently, and then associate each book with its respective <code>Author</code> using the one-to-many relationship.</li>
        <li>Implement the many-to-many relationship by introducing a join table (association table) to manage the relationship between <code>Book</code> and <code>Author</code> entities. Save <code>Book</code> and <code>Author</code> entities independently, and then associate them using the many-to-many relationship.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Test the relationships by creating authors and books, ensuring that the relationships are correctly maintained.</li>
</ol>


<li>A <code>README.md</code> file providing a brief description of the assignment, instructions on how to run the application, and any important notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions to Run the Application:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone or download this GitHub repository to your local machine.</li>
<li>Set up a suitable database (e.g., MySQL, H2) and configure the database connection details in the project's configuration files.</li>
<li>Build and run the Java project.</li>
<li>The console-based application will guide you through testing the CRUD operations and entity relationships.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.</li>
<li>Make sure the required dependencies (e.g., Hibernate) are added to the project.</li>
<li>Double-check the database configuration to ensure proper connectivity.</li>
<li>Follow the best practices for code organization and documentation.</li>
</ul>
